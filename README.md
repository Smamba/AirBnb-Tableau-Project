Project Description: AirBnB in NewYork has always been a very controversial topic and this raised out curiosity to find what actually made it controversial and why it needs to be looked at.

Background:

The Airbnb Open Data dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of 26 different KPIs and a total of 102,599 data points. The dataset includes missing and incorrect data values. For the analysis using Tableau, we filtered out the null values and made changes to the data types where necessary. For example, we modified the price column to remove the '$' sign as it was originally in string format.
Our analysis began with the problem of finding specific areas where Airbnb could increase its listings to improve revenue. We explored several questions such as which neighbourhoods have the highest number of listings, the average price per night for different room types and neighbourhoods, and the relationship between a property's construction year and its price, number of reviews, or rating.

Analysis & Findings:
Our team discovered that the Financial District has the highest host listings and is rented out frequently due to its popularity. Staten Island has the highest average price per night for an entire home/apartment due to a housing rental crisis issue. Properties constructed after 2018 in Queens, Staten Island, and Bronx command higher prices compared to Brooklyn and Manhattan. East Elmhurst has the highest number of reviews due to their proximity to LaGuardia Airport, competitive pricing, and positive reputation as a safe area which is then followed by Glen Oaks.
Market competition and guest preferences influenced Airbnb hosts' pricing and cancellation policies. Instant bookable listings had higher demand than non-instant bookable ones. Manhattan and Brooklyn were the most popular neighbourhoods with the highest number of host listings.
As per an article by airbnb news:"New York City welcomed 66 million visitors in 2019, generating $70 billion in revenue, with most growth seen in 2019". The service fee for different neighbourhood groups remained within the range until 2014, after which it considerably increased and remained high until 2022
Our team encountered challenges such as the absence of service fee details before 2014 and the lack of information on last review before 2012.
In conclusion, our analysis provided insights into Airbnb's performance in New York City, its strengths and weaknesses, and the factors that influence its pricing, demand, and growth.
